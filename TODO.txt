MAJOR. WRITE TEST FUNCTIONS
Rewrite Command Parsing:
	When a line is input
	Check if the line is a command
		If it isnt, end parsing
	If it is
		Strip the command of the command prefix
		Split the line into individual words
		Remove the command from the array of words
		Parse the array based on the following:
			If the word
				Has - at the start
					Put it into the array as is (No quotations around the word)
				Is a singular word
					Put it into the array with quotations around it
				Is a word with quotes around it (at the start and end)
					Put it into the array as is
				Has quotes at the START of the word but not the end
					Begin constructing into a phrase as one word
				Has quotes at the END of the word
					If we previously began constructing a phrase
						Put this word in the phrase, then put the phrase in an array
					Otherwise, put quotes around it
			If we reach the end of the phrase we are parsing and we havent finished creating the phrase
				Finish the phrase, put a quote at the end of it, and put the phrase into the array
		Using the array of words and phrases
			Check the array for options, and construct an object based on these options
			When array is done, return an object that contains
				Another object with key value pairs of options: list of option modifiers
				A list of the remaining words and phrases that werent an option of related to options
		Pass the list and the object into the command's function.
Add poll options
	-s (Hides poll votes until the end)
	-t [time] (Sets timer in minutes)
